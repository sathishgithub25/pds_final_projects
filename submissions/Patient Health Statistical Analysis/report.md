### Introduction of Project ####
Our project task is "Patient statistical Health Analysis".To analyze the statistical method of patient health,we need a data set.Due to this reason,we have created a dataset  using some python coding which contains the six attributes.Then,we have calculated the mean,mode,median of some attribute as per our project task.

### Data ###
In our project,dataset contains 10 patient details such as patient_name,patient_id,height,temparature,disease,Hospital,Cost.
 a.Randomly assign the Patient_id and patient_name in integer and string format repectively.
 b.Then randomly assign the disease to 10 patients using some python command.
 c.After that we add the attribute Hospital and cost as per patient_id randomly.
 d.Then we obtain final dataset containing the above mentioned attribute.
 e.Lastly,we have calculated mean mode median of some attribute as per project.

 #### Question and Answers ####
 Q1.      How one can create a data set using pandas?
 Answer:  Using "pandas library" function we can make a dataset.

 Q2. How can we create a list containing three elements to list containing 10 elements?
 Answer:   using "random.choice" function we can make a list from three elements to list of ten elements.
 
 Q3. How to calculate the mean, median,mode of a dataset?
 Answer:   a) mean is calculated by "sum up the number of elements divided by number of elements".
           b) To find out the median at first we have to arrange the elements from smallest to largest.Then if number of elements in the list is odd then middlemost element is the median or if number of elements is even then average of (n/2)th+[(n/2)+1]th term is the median of dataset.
           c)mode is the most frquently occuring number in a dataset.
